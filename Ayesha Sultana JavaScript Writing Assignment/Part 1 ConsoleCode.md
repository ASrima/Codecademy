 Chrome JavaScript Developer Console
Chrome has some really good developer tools like HTML and CSS inspector. In Chrome we can use the JavaScript Developer Console to write JavaScript codes 
and test them at the same time. While learning JavaScript using console will make learning much exciting and easy. Console is like a friend for JavaScript
 who tells where it goes wrong and which line should be fixed to get rid of the error in the code. To open the console on chrome hit f12 or click the mouse 
and click on Inspect Element and there is a tab called console or just click view/ More tools/Developer Tools in Chrome. Console allows us to write JavaScript 
in our browser. 
So, lets have some fun writing some JavaScript code inside the JavaScript console.


var Googlelogo = document.querySelector("#hplogo");
setInterval(function () {
Googlelogo.width += 10;
}, 200)



Paste these codes in the console and don’t worry about the codes this is an example for you to try and see how cool JavaScript can be
 and get excited about learning JavaScript to do cool stuff in the future. So, just observe what happens. What will happen is once we hit enter, the code will be 
executed, and the code will do a simple animation on the google logo image by adding 10 pixels to the width of the image in every 200 milliseconds. You could try 
changing the width and the timing and see what happens. We can also write an alert message inside the JavaScript console that will pop up on the browser by writing
 alert("Watch out for your heart. You might fall for JavaScirpt");
