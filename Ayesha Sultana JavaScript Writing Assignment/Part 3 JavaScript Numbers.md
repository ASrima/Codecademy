Let’s get an even better understanding of JavaScript numbers.

If we type a simple number inside the JavaScript console it returns us the same value. If we type a value, it will return back the same value whether we type a
 positive or negative number. For example, if in our console we type
>50 // it will return 50 back
> -60 // it will return -60 back
We can also do mathematical operations like addition(+), subtraction(-), division(/) and multiplication(*)  in JavaScript using Numbers.
Example of Addition:
>50 + 2 // expected output is 52
> 200  +  50 // expected output is 250
> 3+2+1 //expected output is 6
# Remember that in JavaScript white space is ignored and it  has no effect on the output of the code whether you use one or two spaces on either side of 
the plus/addition sign. 

Example of subtraction:
>30-20 // expected output is 10
>50-60-2 //expected output is -12

Example of division:
>10/5 //expected output is 2
>3/2 //expected output is 1.5

Example of multiplication:
>15*3 //expected output is 45

We will also discuss another concept of JavaScript which is, JavaScript follows the order of operations like all regular math. For example 
> (10 -5) *15 //expected output is 75

Here the prentices denotes that the subtractions of (10 -5) needs to be done first and then the value should be multiplied by 15 to get the final output. 
We will also discuss another JavaScript operator which is known as Modulo and also often called as a remainder operator. Modulo also uses a sign like other 
operators (+, -, *, /) which is a percentage sign (%). For example,

>10 % 3 // expected output is 1

Here the Modulo operator will take 3 and divide it into 10 as many times as it goes in as a whole number and then it will take the remainder. Because 3 goes 
into 10 three times that leaves a remainder of 1.
If we look at another example of Modulo
>50%10 // expected output is 0
Because 10 goes into 50 five times there is no remainder, so we get 0.
